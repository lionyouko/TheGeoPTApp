# TheGeoPTApp


I am making this public so it can be consulted by hiring managers.
It is a project I first built, but, as it is old, it only serves to evaluate my android skills upon the last time I was able to dedicate to 
Android.

Next step would make it in Kotlin once Kotlin is learnt. 

This project is just android client of The Geo API PT opensource project: https://github.com/jfoclpf/geoapi.pt
